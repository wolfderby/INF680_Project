Three Way Handshake 

The three-way handshake of TCP/IP This is how an end user device and a server establish a connection. It is called a three-way handshake because it is a three-step process to establish a TCP connection.  

 

The first step starts with the End User or Client machine. This machine sends a Synchronization Request (SYN) to the Server.  

Next, the Server then replies with a SYN ACK. This Acknowledges the SYN request and the SYN from the server signifies the sequence number it will start with. 

Finally The Client then Acknowledges the Servers message, and connection has been established.
