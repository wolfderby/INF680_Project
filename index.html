  <h3>TCP Header</h3>
The image below shows the breakdown of a TCP header. The size of the header can be no smaller than 20 bytes and can have up to 40 bytes of options for a total of 60 bytes. 
<br/>
The required 20 bytes consist of the parts listed below: 
<br/>

The first part of the Header is the Source Port Address. This is a 16-bit field that has the port address of the application that is sending the data segment 
<br/>

The Next part is the Destination Port Address. This is also a 16-bit field and holds the port address of the receiver. 
<br/>
After addresses we get to the Sequence number portion. This is a 32-bit field that is used to reassemble the message if the segments are received out of order.  
<br/>
Then we get the Acknowledgment Number. This is the byte number that acknowledges that they previous byte number was received successfully. 
<br/>

Next, we get the Header Length field. This is a 4-bit field that indicates the length of the header by the number of 4-byte words in the header. If the header is 20 bytes the value will be 5 (0101), because 5*4=20, if the header is 60 bytes the value will be 15 (1111), because 15*4=60. 
<br/>

Then there are the Control Flags. These are 6 1-bit fields that control connection establishment, termination and abortion, flow control and other important connection information they are 
<br/>

URG: Urgent point valid<br/>

ACK: Acknowledgement and number<br/>

PSH: Push Request<br/>

RST: Connection Reset<br/>

SYN: Synchronize sequence numbers<br/>
FIN: Just like the end of a bad movie (Terminate the connection)<br/>
<br/>    
    The next part of the header is the Window Size, it is what it sounds like. Establishes the size of the window in bytes. <br/>
    
    Then we have the Checksum. This field is for error control, it holds the checksum. <br/>
    
    Then we have the Urgent Pointer. This field is only valid when the URG flag is set. This field is used to point the urgent data to reach the receiver earliest. <br/>

    This sums up the required bits of a TCP Header. </h3>

  <h3> Sliding Window Scheme </h3>
  Sliding window flow control is an efficient way to control the flow of data to a receiver. This method of flow control allows a transmitter and the receiver to agree on how many frames can be sent at one time, instead of sending one at a time and waiting for acknowledgments. It works like this: <br />
  <br />
  The transmitter and the receiver make contact and agree upon how many frames can be sent and received at a time. The below example shows what happens when the agreed upon rate is 7 frames.  <br />
  <br />
  So, the transmitter sends the agreed upon 7 frames. Then when the receiver is ready to receive another 7 frames it will send an ACK to the transmitter letting it know it is ready. The below example shows this occurring at Frame 4 (ACK5). This means the receiver is ready for 7 more frames starting frame 5. <br />
  <br />
  The transmitter knows it has already sent frames 5-7 so it does not send them again, instead it sends frames 8-11 because the receiver can only receive 7 frames and has not acknowledged anything over 4 yet.  <br />
  <br />
  This process will continue in this fashion until the receiver has received all the frames. If the receiver can keep up with the pace of the incoming frames it will continue to send out frequent ACK’s and the transmitter will continuously send out frames because it never fills its buffer window. <br />

  <h3>TCP – Transmission Control Protocol </h3>
  TCP offers a reliable connection-oriented service.  Together these two protocols carry most of the communications across the Internet. <br />
  
  TCP is a layer 4 protocol. Layer 4 protocols are responsible for the openings of connections, acknowledging the receipt of data, defines the service at the destination that should be used to handle the segments and notifying the receiver what service sent the segment.<br />

  TCP is the best choice when you want to ensure that the data is sent accurately and completely. This protocol ensures that every bit of data that is sent arrives error free, preventing documents and files from becoming corrupted. This process involves using a sliding window flow control over the logical connection. The flow control and error messages are sent through this mechanism. All these steps in the process are what ensure that exact duplication of the file occurs. <br />
  
  So, what uses TCP? High-level protocols that need to transmit data use TCP. These protocols include FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SSH (Secure Shell), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, general web access) and Email messages through IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol, POP (Post Office Protocol) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) <br />
  <br />
  
  <h3>Three Way Handshake </h3>
  The three-way handshake of TCP/IP This is how an end user device and a server establish a connection. It is called a three-way handshake because it is a three-step process to establish a TCP connection.  <br />
  
  The first step starts with the End User or Client machine. This machine sends a Synchronization Request (SYN) to the Server.  <br />
  
  Next, the Server then replies with a SYN ACK. This Acknowledges the SYN request and the SYN from the server signifies the sequence number it will start with. <br />
  
  Finally The Client then Acknowledges<br />
